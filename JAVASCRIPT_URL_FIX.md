# JavaScript URL Concatenation Fix

## Issue Description
When clicking "Add New Student" or other modal actions, AJAX requests were returning 404 errors due to missing slashes in URL concatenation.

### Example Error
```
POST http://localhost/pedro-elem-schoolcomponent/student-management/source
                      ↑ Missing slash between BASE_PATH and endpoint
```

## Root Cause
JavaScript files were concatenating `URL_BASED` (from `BASE_PATH`) with endpoint paths without ensuring there was a `/` separator between them.

**Before (Broken):**
```javascript
const module = `${URL_BASED}component/student-management/`;
// Result: /pedro-elem-schoolcomponent/student-management/
//                         ↑ Missing slash
```

**After (Fixed):**
```javascript
const module = URL_BASED + (URL_BASED && !URL_BASED.endsWith('/') ? '/' : '') + 'component/student-management/';
// Result: /pedro-elem-school/component/student-management/
//                          ↑ Slash added correctly
```

## Files Fixed

### Core JavaScript
1. `core/public/js/main.js` - Fixed `modalOpen()` function

### Component JavaScript Files (10 files)
1. `core/components/AnnouncementController/js/custom.js`
2. `core/components/CurriculumManagementController/js/custom.js`
3. `core/components/FacultyManagementController/js/custom.js`
4. `core/components/ManageGradelevelController/js/custom.js`
5. `core/components/ManageRegistrationController/js/custom.js`
6. `core/components/ManageSectionController/js/custom.js`
7. `core/components/ManageSubjectsController/js/custom.js`
8. `core/components/MyProfileController/js/custom.js`
9. `core/components/StudentManagementController/js/custom.js`
10. `core/components/UserManagementController/js/custom.js`

## Fix Pattern

All URL concatenations now use this pattern:
```javascript
URL_BASED + (URL_BASED && !URL_BASED.endsWith('/') ? '/' : '') + 'endpoint/path/'
```

This ensures:
- ✅ If `URL_BASED` is `/pedro-elem-school`, adds `/` → `/pedro-elem-school/endpoint/`
- ✅ If `URL_BASED` is `/pedro-elem-school/`, no extra `/` → `/pedro-elem-school/endpoint/`
- ✅ If `URL_BASED` is empty ``, adds `/` → `/endpoint/`

## Testing

After this fix, all modal actions should work correctly:
- ✅ Add New Student
- ✅ Edit Student
- ✅ Delete Student
- ✅ Add New User
- ✅ Add Faculty
- ✅ Manage Sections
- ✅ Manage Subjects
- ✅ Manage Grade Levels
- ✅ Curriculum Management
- ✅ Registration Management
- ✅ Announcements

## Related Configuration

This fix works in conjunction with the centralized URL configuration:
- **Config File:** `core/config.env`
- **Variable:** `BASE_PATH=/pedro-elem-school`
- **Documentation:** See `URL_CONFIGURATION.md`

## Browser Console Verification

After the fix, you should see correct URLs in the browser console:
```
POST http://localhost/pedro-elem-school/component/student-management/source
                      ✅ Slash is present
```

## Notes

- This fix handles all BASE_PATH configurations (root, subdirectory, etc.)
- No code changes needed when changing `BASE_PATH` in config.env
- All AJAX endpoints now construct URLs correctly
- Compatible with both development and production environments
